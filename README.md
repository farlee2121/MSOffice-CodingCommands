# MSOffice-CodingCommands
Add common coding commenting or swap lines to office programs.

# Currently only supports Word. 

NOTE (for contributors): We can only access key binding throught the global process hooks.\
This means that when you are debugging, you will have to place your cursor and then press
the key combo while in VisualStudio (since it owns the process). Features are coming for
key bindings. See WordCodeCommands > ReadMe.md
